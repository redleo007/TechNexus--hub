## 🎯 One-Minute Deploy Summary

```
1. Supabase: Create project → Get SUPABASE_URL & KEY
2. Render: Deploy backend → Set Supabase env vars → Get URL
3. Netlify: Deploy frontend → Set VITE_API_URL to Render URL
4. Test: Visit your Netlify URL → Try the app
```

---

## 🧪 Testing URLs

### Health Check
```bash
curl https://technexus-backend.onrender.com/health
```
Expected: `{"status":"ok","timestamp":"..."}`

### Frontend
```
https://[your-site].netlify.app
```

### API Examples
```
GET  /api/events
GET  /api/participants
GET  /api/volunteers
POST /api/attendance
```

---

## 📞 Quick Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| **API not found** | Check VITE_API_URL in Netlify |
| **Build failed** | Check build logs in dashboard |
| **Database error** | Verify SUPABASE_URL & KEY in Render |
| **Page won't load** | Check frontend is published on Netlify |
| **No data showing** | Run SUPABASE_SETUP.sql migrations |

---

## 📚 Documentation Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **QUICK_DEPLOY.md** | Step-by-step instructions |
| **ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md** | How to get credentials |
| **DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md** | Detailed reference |
| **DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md** | Verification list |

## 🔐 Security Reminders

✅ **Do:**
- Use environment variables for secrets
- Keep .env files out of git
- Use strong passwords
- Enable 2FA on accounts

❌ **Don't:**
- Commit secrets to GitHub
- Share credentials in messages
- Use same password everywhere
- Expose keys in error logs

## ⏱️ Time Estimates

| Task | Time |
|------|------|
| Setup accounts | 10 min |
| Configure Supabase | 5 min |
| Deploy backend | 5 min |
| Deploy frontend | 5 min |
| Testing | 10 min |
| **Total** | **35 min** |

## 🔄 After First Deployment

Just use Git normally:

```bash
# Make changes
git add .
git commit -m "My change"
git push origin main

# Netlify & Render automatically:
# - Detect push
# - Build & test
# - Deploy to production
# - Your changes are live!
```

No manual deployment needed!

---

## 📱 End-to-End Flow

```
1. User visits Netlify URL
2. Browser loads React app
3. App makes API call to Render
4. Render queries Supabase
5. Data flows back to user
6. User sees information
```

---

## 🆘 Getting Help

1. Check **DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md** for detailed steps
2. Check service documentation (Render, Netlify, Supabase)
3. Check browser console for errors (F12)
4. Check service logs in respective dashboards
5. Ask on service forums
